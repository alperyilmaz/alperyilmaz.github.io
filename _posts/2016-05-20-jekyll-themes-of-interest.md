After going thru a [long list of themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes), the following themes have some or all capabilities I'd like to have in a theme:

<http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/hmfaysal-omega-theme/>

<https://github.com/holman/left> might not be as pretty as <https://zachholman.com/>

<http://chrisanthropic.github.io/slim-pickins-jekyll-theme/>

<https://rohanchandra.github.io/type-theme/>

<http://aronbordin.com/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/>

<http://bloginn-jekyll.justgoodthemes.com/>

<http://dongchuan.github.io/>

<http://biomadeira.github.io/jasper/>

<http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/>

Not sure if this one has a downloadable theme: <https://mademistakes.com/articles/jekyll-style-guide/>

Highly modified theme: <http://willkoehler.net/2014/08/26/save-50-hours-setting-up-your-jekyll-blog.html>
